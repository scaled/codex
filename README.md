# Codex

This collection of libraries implements a code indexing and querying system. It aims to be
language agnostic, but currently only supports Java. It has rudimentary support for Scala, C#,
ActionScript and other C-like languages, but not proper compiler integration like Java.

It mainly exists as a code indexing backend for the [Scaled] editor, but it is hopefully
sufficiently standalone to be useful outside that context.

Naturally, there is no documentation, but take a look at the code in the `test` project to see how
to use it. It's not tremendously complicated.
